there are a few big variables here but the least important is high possibility of recession in the near future at some point in the next years i expect to be living alone and possibly making significantly less money expecting expenses to go up adjusts the math on the emergency fund how much to have in it but doesnt really change how many months you should keep of col is common advice but you can go higher if your income circumstance is more volatile im considering grad school this really matters expenses going up is fine mo is still very fully funded but if youre going to lose income for a while and or have a large single expense coming up tuition then keeping enough extra to cover those major expenses makes sense if you have large expenses coming up grad school down payment on a house etc it makes sense to keep more cash around otherwise definitely sink that money into your ira the best time to save for retirement is as early as possible,r/personalfinance,comment,3/11/2025,neutral

as a young investor of only a few years experience this is the thing that kind of confounds mein like you say there was a major catalyst that caused catastrophe this basically completely dissipated the foundation the market was built upon hence why it was such a sharp and quick fallbut in we don’t have that major catalyst so much as we have many smaller to medium sized things compounding into negative market conditions while they simultaneously and slowly erode the basis upon which america’s economic success is built upon so it’s kind of like was like a stone monument brought low by a tornado while is more like nature picking up the pace on slowly eroding the stone monument with wind and rainmost of these companies in the us will continue to exist excluding the ones that simply cannot remain profitable with tariffs but then again those probably weren’t good investments anyways so fundamentally we will continue to grow just after a market correction—which we may have already had—and much slower than before so long as this administration keeps its coursemy only worry is that it’s not completely off the table that the idiot in chief and his goons literally create that catastrophic catalyst that could wipe out the economy for exampl us debt default they’re playing with fire but until they add the gasoline we’re mostly on the same trajectory we always were,r/investing,comment,3/13/2025,negative

possibly cost is a real concern but i think the real analysis should include costs associated with damage from extreme weather events the cost of nuclear pales in comparison to damage and rebuilding costs from weather catastrophes i don’t know where energy storage will be at in the future but right now it’s not advanced enough for wind and solar to provide continuous energy if we’re able to crack the energy storage barrier i would agree that wind and solar should make up most of the grid as of now it’s only possible to correct for daily fluctuations but seasonal storage is decades off if everas far as deposits in the us it’s believed that the us has as much as million metric tons of uranium deposits but are uneconomical to extract under current market conditions fossil fuels that were once considered uneconomical changed along with technological advancements such as fracking and horizontal drilling technologies i assume that if we were to dedicate focus to innovating uranium extraction processes we could theoretically supply ourselves with all of the uranium we would ever need you’re absolutely right regarding the waste but lithium batteries pose an issue as well waste from nuclear energy is relatively small compared to the energy produced while managing battery waste is on a whole different volume level batteries can also remain toxic indefinitely and they often end up in landfills rather than specialized containments i’m not saying managing battery waste can’t improve but it certainly poses a greater immediate risk,r/investing,comment,2/25/2025,neutral

hi i’m exploring an idea to help myself understand the hidden drivers behind my spending by tracking layers of context moods emotions eg stress boredom excitement social situations eg peer pressure shopping alone vs with friends wishlist habits eg saving items for later vs buying impulsivelythe goal is to answer questions lik “do i spend more when anxious even if i’ve saved items to a wishlist” “how often do i ignore my wishlist and buy things impulsively in social settings”i’d love your honest opinions value of context “would tracking these details help you make better spending choices or does it feel like overcomplicating things why” personal experience “do you already informally track moods social triggers when spending if so how” wishlist integration “if you could review wishlisted items after a ‘cooling off period’ eg hours tied to your mood would that reduce impulse buys” missing factors “what other contexts matter to you eg time of day physical fatigue location”bonus if you’ve tried to curb impulse spending what’s one thing you wish you understood better about your own habitsps no wrong answers just looking for honest perspectives,r/personalfinance,post,2/22/2025,neutral

based on the math it sounds like your take home is around k month and you spendaround k month hey that is amazing you are saving more than of your income did you just start because if you did that for years you probably could retire but if youd been doing that youd have more to retire at that spending rate you need around million invested since you are young and have young kids id probably want to have more like million invested you have almost no chance of getting to million invested in years since you currently have around million you are saving k k year so you can save an additional million then your current million could conceivably be million however since you have it so liquid it is not going to grow very much do you want to run a rental property business do you have time to do that do you have skills to do that if so it might be an option but if not it is probably not the best for you while working what id do if you wanted to retire earl invest k that is liquid into the market start investing that k month into the market in years youll have one kid out of collegeish one kid ready to start and a year old your expenses probably will not have gone down much however youll probably have millionish if you quit youll add health insurance expenses of as much as k month to your expenses i assume at that point i would just keep trying to save for more years in those years youd save another k getting you close to million your middle kid may be finishing college and so your expenses might be dropping your older kid should be into adulthood i think you could probably buy a rental property at that point back off of work and try to make a go of it youd want to cut your expenses to k month to live off of million and have million invested in the rental if after a year of that it seems enjoyable and profitable use the profits of the first to get another,r/personalfinance,comment,2/26/2025,positive

our household is three adults and we generally spend on groceries including cat food and alcoholif you really want to reduce expenses youll have to give up something we eat plant based proteins especially beans instead of meat for at least half of our meals and we dont buy much processed food we also buy mostly store brand food and weve cut out all soda and junk food we dont buy water either because the local tap water is great you can also look at adjusting the budget categories maybe you could put hosting dinners with friends in a separate category which would allow to to get a better idea of exactly what you are spending there,r/budget,comment,2/28/2025,positive

if you have asset allocation ranges and you rebalance at a set frequency like quarterly or annually you’ll end up harvesting equity market gains after a long stretch of positive returns and averaging into more equity market exposure after a period of drawdown it’s what a lot of foundations endowments and other institutional client money does so for instance if a billion endowment has an equity allocation range of to with quarterly rebalancing they’d sell equity to bring it down to million in a bull market redeploying it to other asset classes and if it fell below million they’d put more into equities a lot of moving parts and a bit over simplified to give you the gist the ranges and rebalancing frequency are usually a product of analysis by an investment consulting firm for an individual a cfp is probably a good equivalent and will help you set ranges and rebalancing frequencythat is in a way market timing because it forces trimming exposure after a big positive run and moving money out of safer stuff after a big drawdown aside from tax planning it’s probably the highest value added thing they do if you’re going it alone consider how much safe money you need first and set your allocation to keep that no matter what once that base is covered you have to consider your goals risk tolerance cash needs time horizon etc to set your allocation ranges it’s not an exact science because risk tolerance is where you acknowledge the emotion of fear and goals are where you acknowledge the emotion of greed or to be more gracious hope wherever you land on this you write down that range and you stick to that plan no matter what and in the long run you’re better off,r/investing,comment,4/6/2025,neutral

white house national economic council director kevin hassett defended president donald trumps tariffs on sunday refuting the idea they will cost american consumers more“so the fact is the countries are angry and retaliating and by the way coming to the table i got a report from the us trade representative last night that more than countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation but theyre doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff and so i dont think that youre going to see a big effect on the consumer in the us because i do think that the reason why we have a persistent long run trade deficit these people have very inelastic supply theyve been dumping goods into the country in order to create jobs say in china” hassett told abc news this week anchor george stephanopoulostrump announced tariffs on nearly all of the uss trading partners on wednesday trumps policy includes a tariff on all imports as well larger tariffs on some individual countries the announcement was met with an immediate and ongoing plunge in global markets as well as various countries levying retaliatory tariffs against the us democratic lawmakers and critics of trumps economic policy raised alarms about a potential recession and adverse effects on the uss relationship with alliesthe universal tariffs went into effect on saturday while tariffs on individual countries are set to go into effect on wednesdayformer treasury secretary larry summers disagreed with hassett’s contention that tariffs will cause a drop in prices for american consumers“this is the biggest self inflicted wound weve put on our economy in history we are increasing inflation because the prices are higher because of the tariffs that gives people less spending power that means fewer jobs summers said after hassetts interview markets are looking at all of that and they think companies are going to be worth trillion less than they thought before these tariffs started and thats just the loss to companies if you add in the loss to consumers a reasonable estimate would probably be something like trillion”,r/wallstreetbets,post,4/6/2025,negative

i was specifically advocating for holding those three etfs in three separate accounts in order to minimize the chance for a wash sale if one is sold in a given account if the same etf eg vbil is held in multiple separate accounts there is no ambiguity that a wash sale would be triggered by a sale at at loss in one account and a purchase within days in another even if one account is held by a spouse there has obviously been no sec determination for this but i personally think it is highly unlikely that sgov usfr and vbil would be considered substantially identical they hold a different number and composition of treasurys with different cusips,r/financialindependence,comment,3/5/2025,neutral

things worth buying in bulk are pantry items you use regularly for me that is peanut butter quick oats rice flour sugar and some spices like garlic powder red bull is cheapest by the case at costco where i live it works out it per can getting better at cooking helps start by picking one aspect of your meal to learn how to cook and keep the rest convenient a lot of people get overwhelmed trying to cook an entire meal from scratch and get frustrated for example if you want to make chicken with rice and veggies make the chicken with a simple sauce and use minute rice and pre cooked veggies learning reliable recipe sites online is also helpful because you learn what you can trust to work sallys baking addiction is great for baked goods taste of home has not let me down yet for meals same with salt and lavender and the chunky chef sam the cooking guy has simple easy to follow youtube recipes freezer space is also ideal for saving money because you can buy things on sale and freeze them till you need it grocery stores often have rotating sales of the same items for example i know my grocery store of choice rotates sales between chicken beef pork and seafood in that order every weeks monthly shop for pantry and fridge items that don’t go bad quick weekly shop for perishables fruits and veggies and whatever meat is on sale,r/budget,comment,2/24/2025,positive

i think a big reason people mention that is the fact that there are substantial costs involved in buying and selling houses and with any mortgage the first few years you mostly pay interest so even if your house skyrockets in value moving every few years eats up most or all of the equity you builtas others have said aside from the psychological benefit of having a month in housing costs financially the benefit is you now have a lot of disposable income left over if your goal is to build long term wealth you should at least invest what you would have paid on a mortgage payment every month and let compound interest do the work for the next years that said money is there to do what you want to in life ultimately so make a plan and a budget and allocate your dollars accordingly,r/personalfinance,comment,4/13/2025,neutral

oregon does not allow credit for casdi i dont know what freetaxusa specifically asked you but i cant imagine why it would need to know your ca income tax withheld especially if it was income tax withheld from a job in caca and or are what are known as reverse credit states that means that if you are a ca resident you cant claim credit for taxes paid to or on you ca return but you can claim credit on your or non resident return for taxes paid to ca on mutually taxed incomei strongly doubt that the question wanted to know how much tax was withheld on any w form it most likely was asking how much tax you paid to ca on your or sourced income this would be a portion of the tax shown on your ca form for example if you earned of your income in oregon it would need to know what of your california tax liability was not of your ca withholdingagain this is my best guess as to what is going on the exact question it asked is important you cant just brush that off,r/tax,comment,2/27/2025,neutral

please read the whole thing before you have a knee jerk judgment on this question i understand variations of it have been asked before but i personally have not seen one with the line of reasoning i am usingif a couple is unmarried living together and has two kids can each claim one kid and hoh statuswhile i know some people are pulling their hair out at this question i would really like an explanation as to why the common line of reasoning is that hoh has to pay more than half of household expenses and two people cant both pay more than half i reject that reasoning because i think it is applying an incorrect definition of the term householdbased on what i can find on and similar sites a household for tax purposes is the taxpayer the taxpayers spouse and any dependents it has nothing to do with the actual physical housingwith that being the case why cant two unmarried people who are essentially roommates for legal purposes each be their own household each with one dependentto abstract it a step further what if these people were not in a relationship at all but simply two strangers each of which had a child who split rent and bills in a house are we saying that each of these people would not be entitled to head of household status on their returnsif you have a concrete answer please cite some type of legitimate authority and if you made it this far without writing me off as a complete idiot thank you,r/tax,post,2/16/2025,neutral

if theyve been in the us for years and presumably working they will get social security in addition to whatever investments they have if their house is paid off and they have some savings then the important thing is to look at their budget after they fully retire if they plan to retire at the question is how much do they need to see them through until they are likely to pass awayin most areas of the us older people who are poorer have a lot of reductions they can apply for this includes reduced property taxes utilities internet etci would look at how much social security they receive and how many years they are likely to live and need to augment their budget with savings they dont need to die with a full bank account and a bunch of investments paying the income such that they dont have to use the principle they just have to not run out of money if their lifestyle is lavish there may be issues but if they live a relatively basic lifestyle and have medicare for health insurance they are likely to be okaymy husband and i are and respectively and have considered this carefully we dont have a house worth nearly as much as your in laws but we have slightly more cash saved then them about k looking ahead our combined social security will be more than enough to live on when my husband takes it at age and we expect to have about k saved by then as well projecting out ahead we will be fine even with relatively modest by some standards savings and lower ss than some it all comes down to lifestyle and what your basic monthly income will look like from ss we wont be staying in a posh care facility that requires you to give them k a month to stay there mind you but we will be okay if youre poor enough you qualify for government in home care or nursing facilities they just take all of your assetsso unless you live in a state which has and enforces filial responsibility laws you probably will not get stuck looking after your in laws,r/personalfinance,comment,3/16/2025,neutral

recently bought a car my original intention was to pay the installments for about a year then pay it off in full to build credit to make it easier to get a good loan for a house purchase later down the line however the apr ended up being higher than anticipated at i do have the option to pay it off in full immediately should eat the higher apr on the car in to get a better rate on future house property purchase or pay it off in full immediately given the higher apr some helpful context additional inf i dont have solid plans to be a homeowner within the next years its not out of the question but im not actively looking right now just trying to plan for the future paying the higher apr for a bit will not put me in financial risk or vulnerability at all just unsure if its worth it please forgive any ignorance and thank you in advance,r/personalfinance,post,4/7/2025,neutral

there are definitely people in middle management and up that project that people wfh are getting away with quiet quitting etc so bringing them into the office gives resistance to that my experience is those same people are just playing social hour half the day instead if they can provide resistance to get them to quit they probably think its a plus because its proof to them that those employees werent invested i do think a number of companies have blown massive amounts of money letting people do work unchecked and its happened where i work it might lean into a political discussion but personally my experience is that its more likely incompetence that due to covid era policy wfh and too much money to invest maybe didnt get as aggressively vetted as they should have been bringing them into work can solve the problem but thats taking a hammer to the problem and doesnt necessarily solve for why your managers green light busted projectsnew hires have little connection to the project this includes people we hire offsite that do regular work i dont want to say this is objectively bad but when prior generations got a lot more personal mentorship basically anyone under or even hasnt you probably need to promote senior leaders to provide more direct versions of going for coffee to give younger people a chancehowever i believe as you do wfh is not protected status and at will is still at risk of being sued claiming to pull people back on site and firing remote workers is a blind way of culling the workforce thats not likely to lead to lawsuits as its not a protected status nor is it really something that is promised in any employment contracts that may exist,r/financialindependence,comment,2/10/2025,neutral

i don’t think this is a good idea for two reasons first borrowing or lending money to family can turn into a problem down the road every time you go on a vacation they might wonder why you aren’t paying them back sooner they might start getting resentful of the things you chose to do with your money knowing that you still owe them it could get awkward for you as well i know this isn’t always the case but it often is if you want to help out family it should be a gift second your parents aren’t in a position to help you if they have to take out a loan to give you this money that’s just a bad idea if they don’t have the cash and it isn’t a small amount of their net worth then they need the money this can lead to making my first point even worse if you lose your job and can’t pay them back for a while this then impacts their ability to pay their loan back if you can afford to pay your parents back why aren’t you just getting your own loan this is just strange for many reasons,r/personalfinance,comment,3/6/2025,negative

appreciate you doing most of the leg work just some small adjustments i think we need to make here to get a cleaner numberfirst off using total value isn’t the best way to measure the impact of retirement cash flows since a lot of assets aren’t actively traded and therefore don’t affect price movements on top of that op asked about the stock market specifically so let’s just exclude bonds from this discussion for now quick search shows that worldwide stock trading volume in was around tas for sizing up how much of that volume is actually coming from k contributions we would need to find total value of contributions that go into buying equities either directly or indirectlybased on the average portfolio allocation of the m americans that participate in the k program lets assume that of contribution dollars go straight to equitiesfeb employment statistics show that number of working americans aged and above that have at least a bachelors degree m is pretty close to total participants in the program so let’s assume median income of contributors would be the same as this group doing a quick weighted average calculation would put median income of someone with a bachelors or higher at around k a yearwhich based on the cited contribution rate would imply total amount flowing into equities from k contributions per year is around bnow this one is a more dubious assumption but if we estimate that all the different paycheck cadences average out to contributions being made about twice a week that would mean about of trading days would be affected by these inflows therefore adjusting the total yearly volume for just the days where we think k contributions flow into the market tt would imply that the inflow alone would be responsible for ~ of price action in stocksconsidering that extra would consist of a few big blocks of buy orders as well i can imagine that would actually have a non insignificant impact on daily price movements,r/investing,comment,3/15/2025,neutral
